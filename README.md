# Springboard's Node Express 1 Assessment

## Description: 

This is an assignment from Springboard's Software Engineering Track that's meant to practice with the fs module, answer conceptual questions about Node, and fix a fake broken
app that is meant to simulate a hypothetical working environment where I'm fixing a former employee's code.
